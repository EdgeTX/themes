# How to contribute to the EdgeTX Themes directory

## Did you intend to create a new theme?
- New themes are always welcome. We simply ask that you ensure that your theme complies with [GitHub's acceptable use policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-hate-speech-and-discrimination).
- As this is a community project, run by volunteers, we reserve the right to not accept some themes, if sexism, hate, racism or politics is involved. In general we ask everybody to be polite, and keep the language used in mind that young people are being potentially present, respect everyone in the community, and refrain from politically biassed contributions
- When submitting your theme via a [Pull Request](https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/pulls), please ensure you have provided all of the [required elements of a theme](https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/blob/themes#description-of-an-edgetx-theme), and have completed the checklist in the pull request. 

## Did you find a bug in a theme?
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/EdgeTX/themes/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description and as much relevant information as possible.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
- Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial will generally not be accepted.
